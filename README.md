# React + GitHub API project
in this web app we're going to impliment a small app that will list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days.

# checkout the demo
Open [https://repo-abdel.web.app/](https://repo-abdel.web.app/) to see the demo

# To get started coding on this project, remember the following steps:
### `yarn` The first time you clone this repo
### `yarn start` anytime you want to start developing. This will watch your JS files and re-run webpack when there are changes
