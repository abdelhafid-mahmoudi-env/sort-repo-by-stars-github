# React + GitHub API project
in this web app we're going to impliment a small app that will list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days.

## To get started coding on this project, remember the following steps:

### `yarn`
the first time you clone this repo

### `yarn start`
anytime you want to start developing. This will watch your JS files and re-run webpack when there are changes

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
